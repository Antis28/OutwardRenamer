# OutwardRenamer
A small utility to speed up the transition from OUTWARD to OUTWARD DEFINITIVE EDITION.

Renames saves to DEFINITIVE EDITION. Just put the executable in your SaveGames directory.

Instructions for manual renaming were taken from here:

For use:
1) go to the SaveGames directory (for example "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Outward\Outward_Defed\SaveGames\");
2) copy your old save and copy Ranamer.exe there;
3) run Ranamer.exe;
4) enjoy the result.
